After doing this you wait for the purchase order to be authorized by people who have the privileges to authorise purchase orders for example the directors or who ever in the company authorises.
<br><br>
<b>Authorising Purchase Orders</b>
<br><br>
Here the directors and authorising officials will log into webERP to look for purchase orders that have been raised and they will either cancel, reject, or authorise  these purchase orders .

       Below are the steps of authorising purchase orders

Click on Main menu

Click on Purchases 

Click on Orders to Authorize

The status of the purchase orders will be pending.

Drop this down and select  authorize ,  then click up date. 

This will enable the person who created purchase orders to print and receive them.In order to Receive a purchase order, it has to be printed  first and sent or emailed to the supplier.
(N.B this can't be done unless the purchase order is authorised)
<br><br>

<li>A purchase order can be  printed as follows.</li>

Click on Main menu 

Then click on Purchase orders .

Go to Search outstanding purchase orders and select the purchase order you are looking for.

You will see the options to  Print ,Receive or modify your purchase orders.(Highlighted in blue) then Click Print .

After printing this purchase order you can send it to the supplier through an email or print it out and post it.</li>
<br><br>
<b>Recieving Purchase Orders</b>
<br><br>
<li>When the supplier delivers the goods to the warehouse , the stock manager will log into  webERP</li>

<li>Click main menu</li> 

<li>Go to Search outstanding purchase orders and click Receive
If the quantities have changed, the changes are effected at this stage. This is because the supplier might not deliver all the ordered  items at the same time , and at this point  we need to record exactly what has been delivered, and not what has been ordered. Enter the prices,
This is because some times the supplier might not deliver all the ordered items at once . He might deliver in parts. So these changes  are supposed to be effected at this point before processing a Goods Received Note.</li>

<li>Then click update.</li>

<li>Click on Process a Goods Received (GRN) And finally click on  Print a Goods Received Note (GRN).</li> 

This is signed off by the person who received the goods and given to the supplier 
.
