webERP README

Thankyou for using webERP.

Installation instructions are in the file INSTALL.txt in the doc directory. It is important to read the INSTALL.txt file in its entirety before proceeding. In fact a printout is not a bad idea.

The user documentation contains a wealth of information and is installed under the doc/Manual directory in html format. Links to it are available from the application itself.

SUPPORT

The primary means of support queries is through the user mailing list. 
Please join the list at: http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/web-erp-users

Feedback, wants and gripes are encouraged in the interests of improving this applicaton.
