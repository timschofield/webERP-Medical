/* This file contains the code to post GL transactions.

This file can be included on any page that needs GL postings to be posted eg inquiries or GL reports
GL posting thus becomes an invisible/automatic process to the user

The logic of GL posting consists of:


Then looping through all unposted GL transactions in GLTrans table and

1. Debit amounts increase the charge in the period for the account and credit amounts decrease the charge.
2. Chart Details records for all following periods have the b/fwd balance increased for debit amounts and decreased for credits.
3. Once these updates are done the GLTrans record is flagged as posted.


Notes:

ChartDetail records should already exist - they are created (from includes/DateFunctions.in GetPeriod) when a new period is created or when a new GL account is created for all periods in the periods table. However, we may need to create new ones if the user posts back to a period before periods are currently set up - which is not actually possible with the config parameter ProhibitGLPostingsBefore set (However, is a problem when it is not set)
*
* Is it worth checking that periods are set up for all gltrans periods that exist in gltrans? They should already exist.
